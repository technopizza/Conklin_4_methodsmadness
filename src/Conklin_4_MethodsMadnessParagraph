My program uses several different methods to draw geometric shapes and patterns.
All of the methods utilize geometry to calculate point positions, which are then fed into JavaFX's methods.
My methods can draw A trinity symbol, a regular triangular, a square, and a circle.
I also made a fractal program at home that draws regular polygons in fractal patterns.
I plan to use these methods to create interesting geometric pictures and mesmerizing fractal patterns
